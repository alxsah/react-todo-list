# React Todo List
A minimal todo list built with React and Material UI. Todos are persisted to Local Storage.
## How to use
Press the `+` icon within the table to add a new Todo. After selecting an existing todo from the table, The `pen` icon allows you to edit and the `bin` to delete. The `circle` begins recording actions. Once you have finished recording, `VIEW RECORD` in the top left corner shows your recorded actions and lets you clear them.

## Further ideas for improvement:
- Improved responsiveness / mobile support
- Improved cross browser support
- State management (Redux / Context API?)
- Script for a production build
